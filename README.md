## 1. Project Overview
This project consists of an academic implementation in C language simulating John Horton Conway's cellular automaton known as **The Game of Life** (1970).

The environment represents an orthogonal 2D grid containing discrete cells with binary states: **alive** (`*`) or **dead** (`.`). Cells dynamically evolve through sequential discrete generations determined strictly by the state of their immediate neighborhood.

---

## 2. Conway's Genetic Laws
The simulation executes Conway's classical transitions simultaneously across all matrix elements:

1. **Survival:** Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives into the subsequent generation.
2. **Death (Underpopulation / Overpopulation):**
   - Any live cell with 1 or 0 live neighbors dies of underpopulation/isolation.
   - Any live cell with 4 or more live neighbors dies of overpopulation.
3. **Reproduction (Birth):** Any dead cell surrounded by exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell in the subsequent generation.

---

## 3. Implemented Requirements & Features
According to the official project specifications, the system delivers:

- **Single Cell Operations:** Interactive insertion and removal with real-time coordinate validation and boundary checking.
- **Batch Cell Operations:** Continuous insertion and removal loops that execute until the user explicitly signals to stop (`0`).
- **Full Grid Clearing:** Resets the board, generational clock, and population trackers.
- **Generation Stepping:**
  - Single generation advancement (`advance 1 generation`).
  - Batch simulation advancement (`advance n generations`).
- **Toroidal Topology (Infinite Grid Representation):** The grid implements periodic boundary conditions (wrap-around topology) where:
  - The rightmost column wraps to the leftmost column.
  - The uppermost row wraps to the bottommost row.
- **Real-Time Statistical Engine:**
  - Current count of live cells.
  - Maximum live cells recorded and its corresponding generation index.
  - Minimum live cells recorded and its corresponding generation index.
  - Oldest living cell's age and birth generation.
  - Youngest living cell's age and birth generation.
  - **Dynamic Age Histogram:** Aggregated graphical distribution of cell longevity rendered directly in ASCII.
- **Runtime Configuration Module:**
  - Customizable visible grid dimensions ($N \times M \le 25 \times 25$).
  - Adjustable simulation execution delay (stepping speed in seconds).
  - Configurable toggle for board rendering during multi-generation runs.
  - Configurable toggle for statistics rendering during multi-generation runs.
- **Preset Test Patterns:** Fast-loading shortcuts for canonical configurations (*Glider*, *Blinker*, *Block*, and *Boat*).

## 5. Data Structures & Key Algorithms

### 5.1 Structures
```c
typedef struct {
    int rows;
    int cols;
    float secsPerGen;
    int showGridOnAdvance;
    int showStatsOnAdvance;
} Config;

typedef struct {
    int grid[MAX_SIZE][MAX_SIZE];
    int ages[MAX_SIZE][MAX_SIZE];
    int generation;
    int maxAlive;
    int genMaxAlive;
    int minAlive;
    int genMinAlive;
} LifeGame;
```

### 5.2 Toroidal Neighborhood Algorithm
Rather than relying on deeply nested conditional edge cases, neighbors are computed through modular arithmetic:

```c
neighborRow = (currentRow + deltaRow + totalRows) % totalRows;
neighborCol = (currentCol + deltaCol + totalCols) % totalCols;
```

Where:
- `deltaRow` and `deltaCol` range from `-1` to `1` (excluding `(0, 0)`).
- Adding `totalRows` and `totalCols` prevents negative numbers when checking the top or left borders.
- The modulo operator `%` automatically wraps borders around:
  - Row `-1` wraps to row `totalRows - 1` (top wraps to bottom).
  - Col `totalCols` wraps to col `0` (right wraps to left).

This guarantees constant-time $O(1)$ evaluation for all 8 neighboring cells across the entire grid.

### 5.3 Deterministic Generational Stepping
The next generation state is computed into auxiliary arrays (`nextGrid` and `nextAges`) before overwriting current state buffers, guaranteeing that update passes do not contaminate neighboring cell evaluations during the same generational cycle.

## 9. Code Quality & Standards
- **Memory Safety:** Static allocation with bounds validation prevents buffer overflows and segmentation faults.
- **Robust I/O Processing:** Standard input streams are sanitized via buffer clearing routines (`clearInputBuffer()`), neutralizing trailing newlines and malformed non-integer inputs.
- **Portability:** Clean C99 standard compliant source code with no non-standard proprietary library dependencies.
